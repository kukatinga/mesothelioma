                <h3>Important Legal Information</h3>
                <p>By using this website and its calculator tool, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Disclaimer, our Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. No Legal Advice</h2>
            <p>The content, tools, and estimates provided on this website, including the Mesothelioma Compensation Calculator, are for informational and educational purposes only. They are general in nature and are not intended to be and do not constitute legal or medical advice. The information presented on this site should not be interpreted as a substitute for consultation with a qualified legal or medical professional.</p>
            
            <h2>2. No Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>
            <p>Your use of this website, including the submission of information via the calculator or contact forms, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and mesotheliomacompensationcalculator.com, or between you and any of our partner law firms. An attorney-client relationship can only be formed by a written agreement signed by both you and the attorney.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Estimates Are Not Guarantees</h2>
            <p>The compensation estimate generated by our calculator is a rough approximation based on generalized data from past settlements and verdicts, and on the algorithmic factors you input. This estimate is not a guarantee, promise, or prediction of the actual compensation you may receive. Every mesothelioma case is unique, and the actual value of a claim depends on a multitude of factors that can only be properly evaluated by a licensed attorney reviewing the specific details of your case.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Attorney Advertising and Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>This website is a lawyer advertising platform. We are not a law firm. We are a lead generation service that connects potential clients with experienced mesothelioma attorneys.</p>
            <p>If you choose to provide your contact information, it will be shared with one or more third-party law firms in our network. We may receive a referral fee or other compensation from a law firm if you decide to retain them. This financial arrangement helps fund the operation and maintenance of this free resource for the public.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Statute of Limitations</h2>
            <p>All legal claims, including mesothelioma lawsuits, are subject to strict deadlines known as statutes of limitations. These deadlines vary by state and circumstance. We do not guarantee that your claim is within the applicable statute of limitations. It is critical that you contact an attorney immediately to avoid losing your right to file a claim forever.</p>
            
            <h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
            <p>You agree that any reliance upon any information or estimate provided by this website is solely at your own risk. We are not liable for any inaccuracies, errors, or omissions in the content or the calculated estimates.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Confidentiality Warning</h2>
            <p>While we employ industry-standard security measures, do not submit any confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information through this website that you would not want to be shared with our third-party legal partners. Information submitted is not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Licensing of Attorneys</h2>
            <p>The law firms in our network are typically licensed to practice law in specific jurisdictions. We do not make any representation that the law firms we refer you to are certified specialists or are licensed in your state. It is your responsibility to confirm the attorney's credentials.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Prior Results</h2>
            <p>Any descriptions of prior case results on this website do not guarantee or predict a similar outcome in any future case undertaken by any lawyer.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>This disclaimer and the use of this website shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.</p>
